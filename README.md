### Hi there. ðŸ‘‹ <br>
### You may know me as weazoo, but Jeraldy is fine. <br>
I am too lazy to create and maintain an online persona, and so I use Jerald's Mazaingo as my online face. <br>
He's a character from MARIKIN ONLINE 4. :) <br>

I am currently a beginner at programming, as I felt unfulfilled when I was an artist. <br>
Currently learning Lua and JavaScript...
